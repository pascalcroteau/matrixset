# matrixset (development version)

## Improved performance

A complete rewrite of the `apply_` functions have been performed. The initial
goal was to have clearer codes to maintain, but from a user perspective, an 
improvement on speed should be observed as well.

On another positive note, the opportunity of the rewrite was taken to correct
some bugs (see below).

## Improved functionality

* The `mutate_matrix()` function now has access to context functions.
* The `apply_` function family gained a new `.force_name` argument, available
  for the `dfl/dfw` versions. This allows better control in getting meaningful
  IDs to the outcomes.
  
  For instance, using `.force_name` solves the issue
  [#12](https://github.com/pascalcroteau/matrixset/issues/12)
* Functions `join_row_info()` and `join_column_info()` now have more `adjust`
  possibilities to expand matrix sizes when the join operation results in matrix
  expansion.

## Bug correction

* The function `mutate_matrix()` can now accept statements such as 
  `mutate_matrix(ms, foo=bar)`, which was impossible before.
* `apply_matrix_df*` now works when subgroup yields 1 x m or n x 1 matrices.
  This solves [#13](https://github.com/pascalcroteau/matrixset/issues/13)
* [#12](https://github.com/pascalcroteau/matrixset/issues/12) has been resolved
  by the addition of the `.force_name` argument.
* A miss-parametrization of function `join_column_info()` made it impossible to
  be executed. This has now been fixed.
* `matrixset` objects with 0 rows can now be printed.
* sub-setting `matrixset`s that yields 0-row objects is now possible.

# matrixset 0.2.0

## Main new Feature

All `matrixset` objects can now store matrices of class `Matrix`, which allows
sparse and other special matrices.

All `matrixset` extractors or other manipulation functions will work as well.

This is a great way to annotate/manipulate special matrices.

## Other New Features

* There is now a check in apply_row_\*/apply_column_\* family functions to
  prevent names of function result to be identical to tags (typically, .rowname
  or .colname). ([#1](https://github.com/pascalcroteau/matrixset/issues/1))
* In the apply_* family functions, there is now a warning when specifying 
  `.input_list` while `.matrix_wise` is `FALSE`. This answers
   [#5](https://github.com/pascalcroteau/matrixset/issues/5)
   
## Bug Correction

* It is now possible to replace row/col/dimnames of `matrixset` objects with
  partially or completely `NULL` dimnames. This fixes
  [#2](https://github.com/pascalcroteau/matrixset/issues/2)
* When printing, the wrong columns were used for printing truncation. This is
  now fixed.
* padding was sometimes off when printing, which is now resolved. This fixes
  [#6](https://github.com/pascalcroteau/matrixset/issues/6)

# matrixset 0.1.1

* Changed some examples that were commented out by wrapping them in tryCatch
* Lines of the description field of the DESCRIPTION file no longer go over 80
  characters. Also removed sets of consecutive space/linefeed.

# matrixset 0.1.0

CRAN submission.

# matrixset 0.0.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
