## Version 0.1.1, resubmission of version 0.1.0 

In this resubmission, I have adressed the following comments:

1. Some code lines in examples are commented out.
   * I changed the examples by wrapping them in tryCatch
2. Too many spaces in your description field. Probably because linebreaks count 
  as spaces too.
   * Lines of the description field of the DESCRIPTION file no longer go over 80
    characters. Also removed sets of consecutive space/linefeed.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
